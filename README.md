South East Asian Swimming Games Analysis for Singapore
How does the average time per meter varies between the male and female Singapore swimmers in Southeast Asian Games(SEA) since 2007?

The above graph clearly visualizes the reasearch question - difference between average time of male and female Singapore swimmers in Southeast Asian Games(SEA) since 2007.

From the respective SEA games wikipedia page, I have gathered the data and cleaned it to the accurate(truthfulness). My final dataframe has Event eg - 100, 200 etc.(in meters),Gold, Silver, Bronze medals and their corresponding winning time. From this data, I have calculated the average time per meter for Singapore swimmers(functionality). That would be equal to total time taken by all the Singapore swimmers to total distance covered.

     Avg time per meter = total time /total distance

Note: Lower the time, higher the performance.
From the graph, it is evident that for MALE swimmers, the time drops and rises every consecutive years. That means MALE swimmers are not consistent in all these years. Whereas, Singapore Female Swimmers were consitent in the last 4 years, though they had huge peak and drop in the initial years. On the whole, Male swimmers performed better than female swimmers in all years except 2011 and 2015(covered  Cairo's principles of truthfulness, functionality, beauty, and insightfulness).
